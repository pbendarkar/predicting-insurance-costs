The Covid pandemic has been the pivoting point for both normal people and health professionals. With the exponential increase in the different and dangerous types of diseases, it is necessary to capture the potential cause of the disease and its consequences. In todayâ€™s world, it is evident that the cost of healthcare is extremely high. Hence, identifying the insurance costs in the healthcare industry is crucial for any individual to stay abreast with the expensive treatments available. This research study explores three of the many regression algorithms available namely, linear, random forest, and XGB to ultimately assist in the cost prediction of healthcare insurance. With primary question for research of whether machine learning (ML) algorithms can give accurate results because of demographic and health-related variables performance of these three algorithms is evaluated based on evaluation metrics of RSME, R2, MSE, MAE, and Model score. The data is collected from the open-source platform and the models are trained with the collected and cleaned data. Evaluating the performance of the models with the decided metrics, the results can show all the models were capable to predict the costs, but the random forest (RF) was found to outperform all the other models in the study. This attempt will be useful for all healthcare providers, professionals, and policymakers who are actively involved in seeking or developing healthcare insurance services to make better decisions about healthcare policies and access and provide affordability to patients.
